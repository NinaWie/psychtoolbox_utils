## Psychtoolbox Snippets and Tools

This repo is a collection of very short and simple functions that might be useful for any experiment writen in MATLAB and Psychtoolbox. 

Each file is self-contained and only provides a single functionality that can be plugged in an experiment. So far, there is code for

* Drawing arrows
* Drawing simple formated text
* Waiting for keyboard input to continue to the next screen
* Rate something on a scale (for questionaires)
* N-back task


### Installation

[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html) and [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/download) are required.


### Test and run

To understand the functionality of these functions, simple run 

```
test_utils.m
```

This short script calls each of the functions in one line and displays the results.
